## Task Overview
This project involves training a machine learning model to detect malware based on a dataset of emulated malware samples. The steps below outline the process to get acquainted with relevant materials, understand the necessary code, and train the model for testing.

## Steps:
### 1. **Read the Article**
   - Familiarize yourself with the details of the project by reading the research paper:
   [Nebula: Self-Attention for Dynamic Malware Analysis (PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10664).
   - The article provides background information, methodologies, and approaches used for detecting malware using many techniques, which will be key to understanding how the dataset and model work.

### 2. **Dataset**
   - Download the dataset used for training the model:
   [Quo Vadis: Dynamic Malware Analysis Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmitrijstrizna/quo-vadis-malware-emulation).
   - This dataset includes various features for emulated malware, which will be utilized to train and test the machine learning model.

### 3. **Understand the Code**
   - Review the code from the repository:
   [Nebula GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dtrizna/nebula/tree/main).
   - Focus on understanding how the data is tokenized and processed for training the model. 
   - Ignore the API section and focus on the core model training pipeline.

### 4. **Model Training**
   - Download the dataset, preprocess the data (tokenize, normalize, etc.), and train the model based on the guidance from the repository.
   - Use the trained model to evaluate its performance on the test samples.
